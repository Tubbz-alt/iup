# IUP wrapper 
This is a nim wrapper for the [IUP](http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/) GUI toolkit.

## History
The wrapper was originally part of the standard library. This project was created to remove it from the standard library, 
update it to the latest version of IUP and integrate it with nimble.

## Versioning
This library uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) with a small modification. The Major and Minor versions of this library
will always sync with the major and minor version of IUP. If you are using version 3.16 of IUP then you would use version 3.16.x of this
wrapper. 

## Install
Install nim and nimble

	nimble install iup

## Documentation
Please visit the [IUP documentation](http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/) for details about the toolkit.

## Examples
A few nim-specific examples can be found in the `examples/` directory. For more comprehensive examples visit the 
[IUP documentation](http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/examples/C/).
